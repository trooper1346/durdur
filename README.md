School years are the most amazing years in life of every person. 
Strict and lenient teachers, difficult and easy subjects and of course holidays – all these things will never slip our memory. Although most of pupils go to school reluctantly,
in the future they will probably have a strong desire to return those days of joy and lightheartedness. So, let’s remember what the ordinary school days of pupils are.
Every time a teacher goes into the classroom, she always asks the same questions. They sound as follows:
“Who is on duty?” and “Who is a monitor?”. Then she usually demands to show the written homework and hears a lesson. That’s how teachers check the knowledge of the pupils. 
If somebody didn’t learn the subject, she would open a record book and give bad marks to the ones who can’t recite a lesson.
Filling in the record book, she asks “Who is absent?” and then wonders why this pupil missed the classes and didn’t attend school. 
There are two versions: either he or she just plays truant or a pupil just fell ill.
Soon, summer holidays will begin – the longest holidays of the year.
Everything seems to be just great, except for one snag called exams. Someone will pass it easily and the other will scrape through it. Nevertheless, 
in the future none of them will forget hard and at the same time funny school years.
